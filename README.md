This project will be an e-commerce website built using Java-Spring, the storage method will be SQLite.
The user will utilize the project to purchase sports cars via an online shopping interface. 
There will also be an administrative side which will allow a registered administrator to change the inventory and view the sales history.
The program will feature a database that will keep track of customers, purchases, and inventory all accessible via the administrator end.
