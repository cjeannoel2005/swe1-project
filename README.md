# **The buggers - Intro to Software Engineering Project (Group 2)**

Welcome to the SWE 3313 Team 2 project repository! This README file contains documentation, presentations, team resumes, and source code for an e-commerce website project. The site is built using Java-Spring and SQLite, allowing users to purchase sports cars through an online shopping interface. It includes an admin side for managing inventory and viewing sales history. A database will track customers, purchases, and inventory, with access limited to administrators. Documentation and updates will be provided here as the project progresses.



# **Project Plan**
Our project plan can be found in Youtrack.

## Meet our team: 
 - [Keaton Surfield](/Resumes/Keaton_Resume.md)


 - [Cedric-O Jean-Noel](/Resumes/Cedric_Resume.md)


 - [Amantur Abdumalikov](/Resumes/Amantur_Resume.md)


 - [Aiden Diaz](/Resumes/Aiden_Resume.md)

   
This group came together with the common interest that we are all familiar with and comfortable using Java.
We thoroughly researched the different options of what stack to settle on. 
From that point, we discussed the product we would be selling and decided on the roles for the full length of the
project.
## Team Assignment


- To disperse the work from this project equally, we compartmentalized two different sections: the administrative and the technical sections. Click this link [Team Assignment](Team_Assignments.md) to be directed to the team assignment section

## **Project requirements**

In this part, we highlight the core of this project, including information gathered from the meetings with the clients, detailed system requirements, and a display of functionality.

## **Technology Selection**


- We decided to use Java with the Spring Framework for this project. We are using SQLite as our database storage implementation.

## **Project Gantt Chart**
- The Gantt Chart for the following project is available on Youtrack along with the deadlines.

## **UI Design** 
 Below you will find the UI design that was made using Marvel UI.

## **Technical Design** 
 This section will outline the technical specifications and architectural decisions for our e-commerce application. Here you will find the specifics on our [Database Design Plan](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/Data_Storage_Plan.md) and our [Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/Coding_Rules.md) and general [Implimentation Strategy](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/Implementation_Information.md). Also included is some [Seed Data](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/Seed_Data.md) and [Example Data](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/Example_Data.md) portraying what our site will require and how the database will look once populated with info after we launch version 1. Lastly we devised an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/cjeannoel2005/swe1-project/blob/main/Technical%20Design/ERD_Diagram.md) to further understand the interactions between the tables and data in our database.
