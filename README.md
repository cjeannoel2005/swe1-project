# **The buggers - Intro to Software Engineering Project (Group 2)**

Welcome to the SWE 3313 Team 2 project repository! This README file contains documentation, presentations, team resumes, and source code for an e-commerce website project. The site is built using Java-Spring and SQLite, allowing users to purchase sports cars through an online shopping interface. It includes an admin side for managing inventory and viewing sales history. A database will track customers, purchases, and inventory, with access limited to administrators. Documentation and updates will be provided here as the project progresses.



# **Project Plan**
Our project plan can be found in Youtrack.

## Meet our team: 
 - [Keaton Surfield](/Resumes/Keaton_Resume.md)


 - [Cedric-O Jean-Noel](/Resumes/Cedric_Resume.md)


 - [Amantur Abdumalikov](/Resumes/Amantur_Resume.md)


 - [Aiden Diaz](/Resumes/Aiden_Resume.md)

   
This group came together with the common interest that we are all familiar with and comfortable using Java.
We thoroughly researched the different options of what stack to settle on. 
From that point, we discussed the product we would be selling and decided on the roles for the full length of the
project.
