# Technology Requirements 

### Language 
- Our language selection for this project is Java. All of us have just completed CSE 1321 & 1322 and are somewhat comfortable using Java for this project.

### Framework
- We chose the Java Spring framework for our library store project because it helps us build the app quickly with an easy setup and includes features like database integration. It also makes development smoother with tools that reduce the amount of work we need to do and ensure the app runs reliably.

### Operating System
- Our team is evenly split in terms of OS preference: two members use Windows, and two use macOS. However, we have selected IntelliJ as our IDE for this project.

### SQLite
- For storage, we decided to use SQLite because of its simple setup, which saves us from having to worry about complex database configuration.

### Marvel UI
-We will also be using Marvel UI for its easy-to-use pre-built components, which simplify framework integration.
