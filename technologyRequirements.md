#**Technology Requirements**

### Language 
1. Our language selection for this project was Java. All of use have just gone through the Cse 1321 & 1322 and are all somewhat comfortable using this as the language for this project.


### Framework
2. We chose the Java Spring framework for our library store project because it helps us build the app quickly with easy setup and includes features like database integration. It also makes development smoother with tools that reduce the amount of work we need to do and ensure the app runs reliably.


### Operating System
3. We are all split equally on the Os we use , 2 people in the group are windows bases and two are macbook based but we have selected Intellij as out IDE for this project


### SQLite
4. For the storage method we decided to use SQLite because of the simple setup which saves up from having to worry about database configuration.
